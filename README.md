# 🎓 C Programming Practicals

This repository contains a collection of C programming exercises completed during my university coursework.  
It includes programs covering core concepts of C such as basic input/output, loops, conditionals, functions (both recursive and non-recursive), arrays, pointers, strings, matrices, and sorting/searching algorithms.

The purpose of this collection is to help beginners understand and practice C programming fundamentals through well-structured examples.  
All programs are written in a clear, simple way and can be compiled using GCC or any standard C compiler.

### 💡 Topics Covered
- Basic programming logic and number manipulation  
- Conditional statements and loops  
- Functions and recursion  
- Arrays and pointers  
- String handling and manipulation  
- Matrix operations  
- Searching and sorting algorithms  

### ⚙️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Joyboycoffee/University-Stuff
